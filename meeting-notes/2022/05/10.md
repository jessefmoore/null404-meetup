# CyberSec Tuesday

## Summary

@croman will be doing an overview of how PKI/digital certs verifies who/what we're communicating with by binding owners to their public keys. He'll provide some core concepts to better understand its use and how critical it is to implement into every production environment. Also, @dfir-jesseee will be doing a quick run down of the adversary simulation tool Atomic Red Team.
